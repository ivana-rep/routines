# HOW TO AVOID SELF-SABOTAGE: RECOGNIZE AND MANAGE TRIGGERS

* Primary Triggers: Boredom and frustration
* Pattern Recognition: Self-sabotaging behaviors are predictable and require specific conditions to occur
* Delayed Reaction: Triggers may lead to self-sabotaging actions even days later

# THE PLAN

1. When the First Self-Sabotaging Thought Arises
* Recognize it
* Acknowledge it
* Consider implementing an emergency routine

2. Develop a Detailed, Scientific Solution. Document the following in Kortex
* The self-sabotaging thought: What you’re planning to do
* Why the trigger was effective
* How bad you’ll feel afterward
* Why your goals matter
* An actionable alternative

3. Reflect and Update
* Record how the plan worked and adjust accordingly
