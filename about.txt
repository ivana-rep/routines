# About this website 

I found a site called Simple Living, https://simpleliving.neocities.org/, aand I thought this minimal approach was exactly what I needed to start a new kind of journaling and tracking habit. 
This specific rep is about logging the routines I apply to help me navigate through my obsessions and addictions and problems.
